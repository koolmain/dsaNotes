*   Merge two binary Max heaps

* Two Approaches
*  1. The property of Max Heap is that the top of any Max Heap is always the largest element. We will use this property to merge the given binary Max Heaps
*            Max Heap â€“ O((N + M)*log(N + M)) Time and O(N + M) Space
*
*  2. [EFFICIENT] Merge and then Build Heap
*            O(N + M) Time and O(N + M) Space:
