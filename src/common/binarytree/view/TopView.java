*   The idea is to do something similar to vertical Order Traversal. Like vertical Order Traversal, we need to put nodes
*   of the same horizontal distance together. We do a level order traversal so that the topmost node
*   at a horizontal node is visited before any other node of the same horizontal distance below it. Hashing is used to check
*    if a node at a given horizontal distance is seen or not.
